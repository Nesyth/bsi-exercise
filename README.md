#### 1. Calculation of average number and standard deviation of years between maintenance
```
Input all years between maintenance actions: 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 
5 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 8 8 8 8 9 9 9 11 15 15 18 20

Average between maintenance actions is 6 years, while standard deviations equals 3.94462
```

#### 2. Checking probability of finding x or more defective items in a string of y
```
How many insulators: 5
How many or more out of 5 is supposed to be defective: 3
Percentage of defectiveness (0.00): 0.1

Probability of finding 3 or more in a string of 5 equals 0.00856
```

#### 3. Finding a probability based on Poisson distribution
```
What's the average probability of the event happening (0.00): 0.1
Time multiplied (default = 1): 1
For how many occurrences you want to calculate the probability: 0

The probability is 0.0904837
```
```
What's the average probability of the event happening (0.00): 0.1
Time multiplied (default = 1): 2
For how many occurrences you want to calculate the probability: 1

The probability is 0.163746
```
#### 4. Checking probability of survival obeying exponential law
```
Enter the probability of survival in provided timespan (0.00): 0.97
Multiply the timespan by (default = 1): 1

Probability of the event happening in provided timespan is 0.97
```
```
Enter the probability of survival in provided timespan (0.00): 0.97
Multiply the timespan by (default = 1): 2

Probability of the event happening in provided timespan is 0.9409
```

#### 5. Calculation of left units after x years based on failure rate per year
```
How many units: 1000
Failure rate per year (0.00): 0.05
How many years: 5

No. of units in service after 5 years is 778.801
No. of units that failed in Year 5 is 39.93
```
